# Switch Controlled Power Box
People with motor disabilities might not be able to power on household devices in a usual manner. Solutions do exist, that makes it possible to power on a device, with the control of a switch. However,  these solutions are often quite expensive and less portable, since they often work as a direct link between two power cables.

This project is a cheap and simple approach, for controlling a power outlet remotely with the push of a switch/button.

The box is able to control an RF controlled (On/Off) device, such as a remote-controlled power plug, without the need for wifi or bluetooth.
